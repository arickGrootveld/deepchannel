\begin{abstract}
This paper serves as an example for the use of the \LaTeX~class file for the 2020 Aerospace Conference. The \LaTeX~class file for the 2020 conference has been modified from that of prior year conferences in order to fix minor bugs and to conform to new formatting requirements. Within the class file there are some customized commands that are illustrated in this paper. They are: tableofcontents, acknowledgments, thebiography. There are also comments sprinkled throughout the~.tex file to illustrate the usage of the class file. If you have difficulties or errors using this class file, please contact me at the e-mail address in the author's information slot. Some of the content below is filler designed to show you how a properly formatted paper should look. Read the official ``Author's Instructions for the 2020 IEEE Aerospace Conference'' to find the full description of the paper formatting requirements.

\section{Introduction}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
The annual IEEE Aerospace Conference is a venue for engineers and scientists to present their work to one another. Please submit a paper only if you or a coauthor are committed to attend and present it personally.

An IEEE Aerospace Conference paper is comprised of standard parts described in Section 2 of this paper. Section 3 briefly describes the manuscript style and Section 4 the submission deadlines and procedures. Section 5 discusses presentation of papers at the conference. The Best Paper Awards and paper publication are described in Section 6. Section 7 provides a summary.

Proper formatting of your paper as specified in this document contributes to the successful production of these documents. All papers are also published in PDF format on the {\it IEEE Xplore} web-based system, shortly after the conference concludes.

A double-column format is required, although figures, tables, and equations may be full-page width. Specifications are listed for typeface, type size, headings, column separation, margins, and other style parameters.

Where this document is silent on a formatting question, it is because it is not important or is the writer's option. When in doubt make a choice that makes your document most readable. English is the official language of the conference, and the official page size is 8.5 x 11 inches--do not use A4 paper size.



%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\section{Paper Organization}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
IEEE papers consist of a minimum of nine parts.

\subsection{Title}
The title should indicate the subject of the paper as briefly as possible. The maximum length, including spaces, is 100 characters.

\subsection{Author(s)}
Names of all authors, their affiliations, postal addresses, and e-mail addresses should follow the title, centered on the full width of the page. Do not include titles or degrees except for military rank. Multiple authors may be listed two or three across and as deep as needed. Large numbers of authors should be grouped by address.

\subsection{Abstract}
An abstract of 250 to 500 words should concisely describe the work being reported, its methodology, principal results and significance.

\subsection{Table of Contents}
Major headings and their page numbers are listed in the Table of Contents.

\subsection{Introduction}
The introduction provides background information, such as previous work, and describes how the paper is organized.

\subsection{Body}
The body describes the work in detail and discusses its application. The body should be organized into logical sections with headings and subheadings and be illustrated with figures and tables. Subsidiary information can be relegated to footnotes.

\subsection{Conclusions}
Conclusions should clearly state principal results of the work, its significance, limitations, advantages, and applications. Recommendations for further work are also encouraged.

\subsection{References}
List and number all bibliographical references at the end of the paper.

\subsection{Biography}
Provide a short biography for each author, which can include title, fields of expertise, work experience, education, and relevant personal information. Also include a 1.25 inch wide x 1.5 inch high headshot (at 300 dpi) of each author.

\subsection{Additions}
Add appendices and acknowledgments, if appropriate.



%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\section{Manuscript Style}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\subsection{Paper Length}
The paper may be 6 to 20 pages in length.

\subsection{Copyright Notice}
A copyright notice must be placed as a footnote on the first page of the paper. Do not number this footnote. Choose an appropriate alternative from the list of four below:
\begin{itemize}
  \item [(1)] For papers in which all authors are employed by the US government, the copyright notice is: \textbf {U.S. Government work not protected by U.S. copyright} \\
  \item [(2)] For papers in which all authors are employees of a Crown Government (UK, Canada, Australia), the copyright notice is: \\{\bf 978-1-7281-2734-7/20/\$31.00 \copyright2020 Crown}\\
  \item [(3)] For papers in which all authors are employed by the European Union, the copyright notice is: \\{\bf 978-1-7281-2734-7/20/\$31.00 \copyright2020 European Union}\\
  \item [(4)]  For all other papers the copyright notice is: \\{\bf  978-1-7281-2734-7/20/\$31.00 \copyright2020 IEEE}
\end{itemize}


\subsection{Paper, Margins, and Spacing}
Format your electronic submission to 8.5 x 11 inch page size in double-column format with 0.75 inch margins on each side, top and bottom. There should be 0.25 inch between columns, which are justified both right and left.

Lines of text should be single-spaced, except for double spacing before headings and space-and-a-half after.

\subsection{Headers and Footers}
No headers are permitted. Utilize footers only for page numbers, which are centered at the bottom of each page.

\subsection{Headings}
\subsubsection{Major Headings}
Centered in the column with a double space before and space-and-a-half after.
\subsubsection{Subheadings}
Italicized and placed flush on the left-hand margin on a separate line. Use a double space before and space-and-a-half after.
\subsubsection{Subsubheadings}
Italicized, followed by an em dash and run in at the beginning of the paragraph. This paragraph has a correctly formatted subsubheading.

\subsection{Other Elements}
\subsubsection{Equations}
Equations should be centered in the column. When numbering an equation, enclose the number in parentheses placed flush with the right-hand margin of the column, as shown in the sample equations that follow.
\begin{equation}
{\bf F}=m{\bf a}
\end{equation}
\begin{equation}
e=mc^2
\end{equation}

Mathematical derivations and proofs should be developed in appendices.

\subsubsection{Figures}
Place figures as close to the text reference as possible. Center figure titles directly below the figure, as shown in Figure 1.

Figures should be sized for easy reading. No lettering in a figure should be smaller than 10 points. Scan photographs at a 300-dpi resolution and embed them in the paper. High-resolution images should be reduced to 300 dpi at the size they will be printed.

\begin{figure*}
\centering
\includegraphics[width=4in]{Placeholder.eps}
\caption{\bf{Here is an example of a figure that spans both columns.}}
\label{FlowChart}
\end{figure*}

\subsubsection{Tables}
Place tables as close to the text reference as possible. Use the full width of the page for legibility, if required. Center table titles directly {\bf above} the table.

\subsubsection{Footnotes}
All footnotes\footnote{\bf This is an example of a footnote.} following the IEEE copyright notice are numbered consecutively.
