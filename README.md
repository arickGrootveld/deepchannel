# Deepchannel
Hey Kirty, if your reading this, then that means this got pushed successfully.

This branch should serve as the remake of the currently existing repository, only cleaner, and
more easily extendable. 

I've worked hard to make the functions readable, and to make the structure of the functions make the
most sense. If there is anything that is not clear, or if there is something that I should add, 
let me know and I'll go ahead and add it. 

As of me writing this, I only have the code written for the data generation and saving. This is
definitely not the complete codebase, as I am missing the implementations for the Kalman Filter,
the Least Squares, and the TCN in the GE Scenario. We also need to add code for the whole 
Maneuvering targets problem that you've been working on this whole time. The implementations are
my next piece of work, with the Maneuvering targets data generation following that. If you
actually found this and read this far, let me know (just tell me you read the README), and 
I will know that this is a good place to put documentation
